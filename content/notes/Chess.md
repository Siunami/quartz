Development in chess is the process of getting your pieces into position for an offensive. ^580040

There is often a [pattern](https://www.chess.com/article/view/the-principles-of-the-opening) to the development starting with your "minor" pieces like knights and bishops followed by "major" pieces like queen and rooks. A weak development would be getting one or two pieces out early and then leaving everything else in the back.
