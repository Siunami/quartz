The design constraints of a pie menu are influenced to two priniciples

Fitt's Law
the amount of time required for a person to move a pointer (e.g., mouse cursor) to a target area is a function of the distance to the target divided by the size of the target.

Pie Menus are unique in that the distance to the target is very small since when you open the menu, the cursor is situated right next to the pie menu options. This minimizes distance.


Miller's Law (The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two)
`average human can hold in working memory is 7 Â± 2.`


Pie Menus should attempt to use even slice amounts. This is because you can leverage symmetry in the slices to make learning the menu easier to learn.
