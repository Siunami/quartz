Domain expertise in people is built from having a lot of timely feedback and repetitions in their environment ^[[Feedback Loops#^21cc49]]

Daniel Kahneman, in comparing Anesthesiologists and Radiologists, they found that Radiologists were only able to predict the presence of breast cancer 70% of the time. This is due to slower feedback loops in prediction and feedback (appearance or non-appearance of breast cancer). ^[[Feedback Loops#^21cc49]]

Other examples of slow feedback loops include predicting a student's grades in freshman year of college based on various aptitude tests, which candidates will violate parole and who will succeed in pilot's training

This also suggests an interesting focus for [[Machine Learning]] research. To look for areas of human activity where feedback loops are slow. In breast cancer diagnoses, you can aggregate all the data and build a machine with a higher prediction rate as it is able to benefit from faster feedback loops.
