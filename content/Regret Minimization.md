title: "Regret Minimization"
---
A framework for making big decisions. At the end of your life, you want to minimize the number of regrets you had in life. 

Oftentimes, it's as simple as trying something you believe to be important. It is unlikely that you regret having tried. It is likely you will wonder "what if" for the rest of your life if you didn't try.

- This long term perspective can make decisions incredibly easy.
- Helps you zoom out from the daily pieces of confusion. Ex: For Jeff, he walked out of a Wall Street Firm mid-year skipping the bonus to start an internet company.
