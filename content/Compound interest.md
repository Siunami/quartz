title: "Compound interest"

Looking for simple examples of principles to make them more tangible. Especially ones with smaller [[Feedback Loops]]. That way it is easier to learn them.

Compound interest

Long feedback loop

Finance takes a lot of time to see compound interest. So it can be hard to wrap your head around the value of investing.

Shorter feedback loop

Physical exercise, you can see the compounding value of it much faster. You're strength, endurance, health and mind benefit incredibly fast.

I also believe this [[Wiki]] will see compounding benefits to my thinking over time. For example, Gordon Brander, who is currently building a tool called [Subconscious](https://subconscious.substack.com/) alongside [Noosphere](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/noosphere-a-protocol-for-thought), keeps up a wiki of [patterns](https://gordonbrander.com/pattern) that he accumulated over time. This has led to a very principled approach to his thinking for his current projects. ^7a0047
