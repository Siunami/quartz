Curious what a word processor of the future may look like

Good writing is just good thinking.

We make the assumption with word processor technology of this existence of a page. And this makes sense because we came from a time where writing took place on pen and paper. So in our digital interfaces we re-create the illusion of a page to make these digital places feel familiar. 

But I'm really curious to challenge this. The computer, and digital interfaces, do not necessarily need to be bound by this page concept. 

We have this definable vessels of different sizes. Letters, words, sentences, paragraphs, essays, books.

And at each of these levels are possibilities to manipulate them in different ways. Words can be replaced with words from the same POS, madlibs style. Sentences can change tone.

Making the process of writing interfaces, of thinking interfaces, more playful.

The foundation of writing is ideas.

So how do we get more ideas for our buck with the words that we write?

Everytime we make text, we are creating a world. How do we explore these idea spaces? The possibilities and secrets within the worlds that we create?

In every piece of writing, we create a world. How do we explore these worlds? How do we expand these worlds? How do we invite other people into these worlds? Leave interesting mini-games and side quests for people to discover.

I want people to create world's like the legend of zelda, or a puzzle game. I want people to 

Want to increase people's creative agency. By making things fun. Make them feel like a game. To bring collaborative and emotional agency to the experiences people 

A playground for words. Means new writing interfaces. Means new ways of thinking.

Thought landscapes
We explore these worlds through search, connections and links
We expand these worlds through prompts, text synthesis and writing
We invite others to these world's through challenges, side-quests, mini-games and wiki

A new type of wiki software
- One that unlocks layers and layers of mini-games, empathy challenges.
- One that gives the feeling of getting lost in the world. You can't just hyperlink to everything. You have to weave your way there.
- That allows people to connect and share ideas. In safe spaces.
- Interesting ways to make sense of a space. Spotify collections, can compare the overlaps in the two.
