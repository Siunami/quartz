This is due to slower feedback loops in prediction and feedback (appearance or non-appearance of breast cancer). ^[[Feedback Loops#^21cc49]]\n\nOther examples of slow feedback loops include predicting a student's grades in freshman year of college based on various aptitude tests, which candidates will violate parole and who will succeed in pilot's training\n\nThis also suggests an interesting focus for [[Machine Learning]] research.

In breast cancer diagnoses, you can aggregate all the data and build a machine with a higher prediction rate as it is able to benefit from faster feedback loops. \n\n\n\n\n\n[The 4 things it takes to be an expert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eW6Eagr9XA\u0026ab_channel=Veritasium) ^21cc49\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-01T06:57:27.906620325Z","tags":null},"/notes/Machine-Learning":{"title":"Machine Learning","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-09-01T06:57:27.906620325Z","tags":null},"/notes/PIe-Menu":{"title":"PIe Menu","content":"The design constraints of a pie menu are influenced to two priniciples\n\nFitt's Law\nthe amount of time required for a person to move a pointer (e.g., mouse cursor) to a target area is a function of the distance to the target divided by the size of the target.\n\nPie Menus are unique in that the distance to the target is very small since when you open the menu, the cursor is situated right next to the pie menu options.
